# Admin exam 17

1. Clone this repo to your account on redbrick.
2. All the questions are in `Exam.md`. You may use your preferred text editor to
   answer.
3. Write your answers in a file named `answers-<username>.md`. e.g answer-pints.md
4. Once you are done commit your answers and open a pull request with them.
   If that's too much bullshit for you, just annoy an admin and they'll get your
   exam from you.
5. Save Early. Save Often
6. Access to manpages is allowed. Access to the internet is NOT allowed. We'll 
   be keeping an eye on your processes, don't try to get around this restriction.
